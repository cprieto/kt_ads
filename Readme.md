# Data structures and algorithms

While learning some algorithms and data structures, I decided to implement them (as they are explained in the book) using Kotlin instead of pseudocode or in C/Java as in the reference books.

Most of these algorithms use mutable structures, a good thing will be to moving to immutable structures in a near future but not right now, I am doing this to prepare for my final algorithms exam in Uni.

So far I have:

 - Comparison sorts:
   * Bubble sort
   * Selection sort
   * Insertion sort
   * Quicksort
   * Merge sort
- Non-comparison sorts:
   * Counting sort

I am writing this together with some [blog posts](http://cprieto.com/tag/data-structures.html)
